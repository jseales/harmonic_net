This net is constructed following the discription in this paper: https://openreview.net/attachment?id=S1ln1TNKvH&name=original_pdf

In the byline, the authors are anonymous, and it is stated that the paper is under double-blind review at ICLR 2020. However, the conference took place in April and it is now August. On the ICLR website, it doesn't appear so I guess it was not accepted. :(

The accepted papers seem to have more to do with neural net features themselves rather than applications thereof, so maybe that's why it wasn't accepted? But isn't the sparse kernel application something that is moving forward neural nets in general? I don't know but I am wondering.
